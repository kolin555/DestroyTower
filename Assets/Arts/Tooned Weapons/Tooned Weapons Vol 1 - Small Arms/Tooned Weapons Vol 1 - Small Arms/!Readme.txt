*** ABOUT ***

Thank you for purchasing Tooned Weapons Vol 1 - Small Arms! This pack contains the following models:

* Pistol
* Revolver
* Uzi SMG

* Pistol bullet + shell (also intended for use with the revolver)
* Uzi bullet + shell

All models also have a low-poly LOD version.

This pack also includes AO bakes and UV maps for all models, along with a "Shared Assets" folder which includes the base textures + color palette used to create the included materials for these models, so that you may make your own textures if you wish.

*** HOW TO USE ***

It is strongly recommended that you start by deleting the subfolders in the "Materials" and "Prefabs" folders for the render pipelines you are not using. (Be sure to also do this for the materials in the "Shared Assets" folder!) This pack is compatible with the Standard, URP, and HDRP render pipelines and includes separate materials and prefabs for each, with the intent that the user will use only those meant for the appropriate pipeline for their project.

The easiest way to use these models is to simply drag and drop the prefabs from the appropriate Prefabs subfolder for your render pipeline into the scene. From there, you can disable attachments in the hierarchy (or simply delete them) to get the combination of attachments you desire. You can also use the armatures attached to each model to animate the various moving parts.

*** IMPORTANT NOTES ***

* Most weapons have a variety of optional attachments. When placing the model or prefab for a weapon into the scene, ***all attachments will be active at once.*** You can disable them in the hierarchy or just delete them entirely to get the combination you desire.

* All weapons have various points of articulation, allowing you to animate reloads and other actions. These vary between weapons - play around with the armature on each model to discover them all!

* All models have a variety of bones in their armature beyond those used for animation. These are used to define points such as the muzzle, character grip points, and accessory attachment points. You can use these to position things such as muzzle flashes, shell ejection, and projectile spawn points. You can also use them to position and attach your own weapon accessories.

* Attachments/accessories are driven by the armature, so if you wish to reposition them, you will need to move the bones to which they are parented (their names and positions should make it clear which ones attach to what). Due to this, you won't be able to move the attachments using their own transforms.
